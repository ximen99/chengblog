# Cheng's Blog

---

This site is just a fun project for me to put what I've learned to use and showcase my work. It's done in React and formatted with Tailwind css. The blog section is some of the data science projects I did when I first landed in Vancouver, settling down and job searching. Hopefully I can add some fun web app to the site later on.
